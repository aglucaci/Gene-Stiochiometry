Inspired by Dr. Jim Elser
Extending the work of environmental stoichiometry to genes.

1. Given a Gene alignment (MSA).
2. Loop, gene by gene over the alignment
  2a. Keep a running sum of the number of atoms in the sequences
3. Print out the gene ID followed by its stoichiometry.

e.g.

ID1 Seq1

# Nucleotides and their atomic composition.
A = {C:[Carbons in A, Oxygens in A, etc.]}
... repeat for all nucleotides.
